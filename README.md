# Tic-Tac-Toe
tic tac toe game with html, css, javascript

OBJECTIVE
The reason I decided to go with a Tic Tac Toe game was to test my own knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS, while utilizing a tutorial to fill in my knowledge gaps.

GAME DESCRIPTION
This Tic Tac Toe follows the original formula. It is a 2 player game, both played by 2 separate players (Computer AI is not implemented yet). You will play on a 3x3 board of squares.

Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O (currently no option to choose which mark you are). Player will take turns by placing their X or O onto the board. The goal is to get either three X's or three O's in a row, and you will win! 

The game will keep track and tally the wins, ties and losses of the rounds. You can click "Actions" > "Reset" to reset the score back to 0.


GAME RULES:
The player that gets to play first will get the "X" mark (Player 1) and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" mark (Player 2).

Player 1 and 2 take turns making moves with Player 1 playing mark “X” and Player 2 playing mark “O”.

Both players are trying to get 3 in a row, which can be achieve either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If none of the players are able to create 3 in a row, the game will end in a draw.
